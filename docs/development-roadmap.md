## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Pipedrive API Changes**: Implement API versioning and fallback mechanisms
- **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance and add indexes as needed
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test on multiple devices and screen sizes
- **Integration Failures**: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features, defer enhancements to later phases
- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize critical path items
- **Dependencies**: Identify and manage external dependencies early
- **Testing Delays**: Start testing early and implement continuous testing

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Provide comprehensive training and documentation
- **Data Migration**: Plan for data import from existing systems
- **Integration Issues**: Maintain fallback mechanisms for Pipedrive sync failures
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor and optimize performance continuously
